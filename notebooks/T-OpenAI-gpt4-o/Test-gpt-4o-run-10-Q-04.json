{"final_response": "Sure! Here is a list of the tools I have access to, along with a short description of each:\n\n1. **List_OpenShift_Operators**\n   - **Description**: Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. It provides details such as name, namespace, version, and status of the operators.\n\n2. **Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**\n   - **Description**: Summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace. It includes details like pod state, count, names of running pods, and any associated service information.\n\n3. **Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**\n   - **Description**: Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. It provides a list of available services and their properties such as name, port numbers, and route information.\n\n4. **List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter**\n   - **Description**: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. It requires details like Prometheus service name, namespace, port, and the filter criteria.\n\n5. **List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range**\n   - **Description**: Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. **Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO**\n   - **Description**: Calculates the timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string of the requested time information. It can handle relative times (e.g., \"3 hours ago\") and the current time.\n\n7. **File_create_plot_irate**\n   - **Description**: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. **MLASP_generate_config**\n   - **Description**: Generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. It searches for the parameter configurations over a specified number of epochs.\n\n9. **RAG_tool**\n   - **Description**: Used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. It looks up queries in a retriever to provide relevant information.\n\n10. **multi_tool_use.parallel**\n    - **Description**: This tool serves as a wrapper for utilizing multiple tools simultaneously. It allows running multiple tools in parallel if they can operate concurrently.\n\nIf you need more detailed information about any specific tool or want to use any of them, feel free to ask!", "total_tokens": 2170, "total_time_seconds": 9.486031532287598, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
