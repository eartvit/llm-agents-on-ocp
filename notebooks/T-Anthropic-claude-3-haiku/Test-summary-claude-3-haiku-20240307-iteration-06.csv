Q-05,6546,3.154097080230713,"Based on the information provided, here are the key steps to create a Data Science project:

1. Gather and prepare data - Ensure the data is complete, high quality, and ready for analysis.

2. Develop the model - Train, test, and select the model with the highest prediction accuracy.

3. Integrate the model - Integrate the model into the application development process for inferencing.

4. Monitor and manage the model - Measure business performance and address potential production data drift.

Some additional suggestions:

- Use Python tools and libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, Dask, Jupyter Notebooks, etc. to build and deploy the data science models.
- Leverage cloud platforms like IBM Watson Studio or Google Cloud AI Platform to simplify model deployment and management.
- Explore parallel computing frameworks like Pachyderm to scale your data processing and analysis.
- Stay up-to-date on the latest data science techniques and best practices.

The key is to take an iterative, experimental approach and continuously improve the model and its integration into the business application. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"

Since I was unable to retrieve the specific metric data you requested, I would suggest investigating further why the metric data may not be available as expected. You could try the following:

1. Check the Prometheus configuration to ensure the 'load_generator_total_msg' metric is being scraped correctly from the 'demo' namespace.
2. Verify the 'load-generator' application is properly instrumented and sending metrics to Prometheus.
3. Check for any errors or issues in the Prometheus or application logs that could provide more insight.
