Q-02,6127,3.6663663387298575,"Apologies, I don't have a ""List_Functions"" tool. Let me instead provide the list and descriptions of the available tools:

1. **List_OpenShift_Operators**: Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.
2. **Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**: Summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace.
3. **Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**: Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace.
4. **List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter**: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.
5. **List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range**: Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.
6. **Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO**: Calculates the timestamp, the ISO formatted string and the timezone string of the requested time information.
7. **File_create_plot_irate**: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.
8. **MLASP_generate_config**: Generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Searches for the parameter configurations a given number of epochs.
9. **RAG_tool**: Use this tool when searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI."

Q-05,6513,4.867556095123291,"The key steps to create a data science project are:

1. Gather and prepare the data - Ensure the input data is complete, cleaned, and of high quality.

2. Develop the model - Train, test, and select the model with the highest prediction accuracy.

3. Integrate the model - Deploy the model and integrate it into the application development process.

4. Monitor and manage the model - Continuously measure the business performance and address potential production data drift.

Some useful tools and technologies for data science projects include:

- Python libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, Dask for data analysis and modeling
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and prototyping
- Anaconda distribution for a secure and compatible Python environment
- Pachyderm for building scalable data science pipelines
- IBM Watson Studio for end-to-end model development and deployment

The key is to have a structured process, leverage the right tools, and continuously iterate and improve the data science models."
