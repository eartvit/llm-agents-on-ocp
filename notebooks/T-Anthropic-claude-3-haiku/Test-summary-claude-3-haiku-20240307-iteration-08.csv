1. **List_OpenShift_Operators**: Lists the OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.
2. **Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**: Summarizes the pods information in an OpenShift namespace, including their state, count, and associated service information.
3. **Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace**: Summarizes the services information in an OpenShift namespace, including their name, port numbers, and route information.
4. **List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter**: Lists the available metric names in a Prometheus instance using a provided filter.
5. **List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range**: Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.
6. **Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO**: Calculates the timestamp, the ISO formatted string, and the timezone string of the requested time information.
7. **File_create_plot_irate**: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.
8. **MLASP_generate_config**: Generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary, searching for the configurations over a specified number of epochs.
9. **RAG_tool**: Provides information about Red Hat OpenShift AI."

Q-05,6515,2.790079116821289,"The key steps to create a data science project are:

1. Gather and prepare data - Ensure the input data is complete, high-quality, and ready for analysis.

2. Develop machine learning models - Train, test, and select the model with the highest predictive accuracy.

3. Integrate models into applications - Deploy the models and integrate them into the application development process.

4. Monitor and manage models - Measure business performance and address any data drift in production.

Some additional tips:

- Use tools like scikit-learn, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to build and experiment with models.
- Consider using GPU computing with tools like Numba for faster model training.
- Leverage cloud platforms like IBM Watson Studio to simplify model deployment.
- Stay up-to-date on the latest open source data science tools and frameworks.

The key is to follow a structured process from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
