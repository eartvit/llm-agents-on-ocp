{"final_response": "The key steps to create a Data Science project are:\n\n1. Gather and prepare data - Ensure the input data is complete and of high quality.\n\n2. Develop the model - This includes training, testing, and selecting the model with the highest prediction accuracy.\n\n3. Integrate the model - Integrate the machine learning models into the application development process and set up inferencing.\n\n4. Monitor and manage the model - Measure business performance and address potential production data drift.\n\nSome helpful tools and resources mentioned include:\n\n- Scikit-learn for building machine learning models\n- Anaconda for a Python and R distribution with data science tools\n- Pachyderm for managing data science pipelines\n- Dask for parallel data analysis\n- Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and model development\n\nThe key is to have a structured approach to gather data, build and deploy models, and monitor their performance in production. Using the right tools can make the process more efficient.", "total_tokens": 6506, "total_time_seconds": 2.753568172454834, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "Data Science Project"}, "id": "toolu_01GUJjUCCFxSnzTqrhrT7gry", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01GUJjUCCFxSnzTqrhrT7gry": "Gather and prepare data to make sure the input data is complete, and of high quality\nDevelop model, including training, testing, and selection of the model with the highest prediction accuracy\nIntegrate models in application development process, and inferencing\nModel monitoring and management, to measure business performance and address potential production data drift\n\napplications.\nBuilding machine learning models with scikit-learn\nLearn how to build machine learning models with\nscikit-learn for supervised learning, unsupervised\nlearning, and classification problems.\nBuilding a binary classification model\nTrain a model to predict if a customer is likely to\nsubscribe to a bank promotion.\nChoosing Python tools for data visualization\nUse the PyViz.org website to help you decide on the\nbest open source Python data visualization tools for\nyou.\nExploring Anaconda for data science\nLearn about Anaconda, a freemium open source\ndistribution of the Python and R programming\nlanguages.\nGetting started with Pachyderm concepts\nLearn Pachyderm\u2019s main concepts by creating\npipelines that perform edge detection on a few\nimages.\nGPU Computing in Python with Numba\nLearn how to create GPU accelerated functions\nusing Numba.\nRun a Python notebook to generate results in IBM\nWatson OpenScale\nRun a Python notebook to create, train, and deploy a\nmachine learning model.\n\nTraining a regression model in Pachyderm\nLearn how to create a sample housing data\nrepository using a Pachyderm cluster to run\nexperiments, analyze data, and set up regression.\nUsing Dask for parallel data analysis\nAnalyze medium-sized datasets in parallel locally\nusing Dask, a parallel computing library that scales\nthe existing Python ecosystem.\nUsing Jupyter notebooks in Watson Studio\nWatch a video about working with Jupyter notebooks\nin Watson Studio.\nUsing Pandas for data analysis in Python\nLearn how to use pandas, a data analysis library for\nthe Python programming language.\nResource Name\nDescription\nTable 6.2.
