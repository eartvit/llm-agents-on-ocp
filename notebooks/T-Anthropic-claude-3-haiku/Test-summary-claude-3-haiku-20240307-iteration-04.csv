1. List_OpenShift_Operators: This tool lists information about the OpenShift operators available in a given namespace, such as the name, version and status of each operator.

2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes the pod information in an OpenShift namespace, including the pod state, count, and any associated service information.

3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes the service information in an OpenShift namespace, including the name, port numbers and route information for each service.

4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: This tool lists the available metric names in a Prometheus instance, using a provided filter.

5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: This tool lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and end timestamp interval for a given metric name in a Prometheus instance.

6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: This tool calculates the timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string for a given time value and metric.

7. File_create_plot_irate: This tool creates a file with a plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and end timestamp interval for a given metric name in a Prometheus instance.

8. MLASP_generate_config: This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary, by searching for the configurations over a given number of epochs.

9. RAG_tool: This tool is used for searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.

Q-07,6563,3.1295881271362305,"Based on the information provided, here are the key steps to create a data science project:

1. Gather and prepare data: Ensure the input data is complete, cleaned, and of high quality.

2. Develop the model: 
   - Train, test, and select the model with the highest prediction accuracy.
   - Use tools like scikit-learn, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks to build and iterate on the model.

3. Integrate the model:
   - Incorporate the model into your application development process.
   - Perform inferencing using the deployed model.

4. Monitor and manage the model:
   - Measure the business performance of the model.
   - Address potential production data drift over time.

5. Leverage supporting tools and frameworks:
   - Use tools like Anaconda, Dask, and Watson Studio to enhance your data science workflow.
   - Take advantage of GPU computing with libraries like Numba.
   - Explore parallel data analysis using tools like Pachyderm.

The key is to have a structured approach covering data preparation, model development, deployment, and ongoing management. Utilize the appropriate tools and frameworks to streamline your data science project lifecycle."
