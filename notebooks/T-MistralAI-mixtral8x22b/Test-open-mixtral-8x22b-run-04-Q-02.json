{"final_response": "Hello! I'm Dave, your helpful assistant. I have access to several tools that can help you with various tasks. Here's a brief overview of each tool:\n\n1. List\\_OpenShift\\_Operators: This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. You need to provide the namespace as a parameter.\n2. Summarize\\_Pods\\_Information\\_In\\_OpenShift\\_Namespace: This tool summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace. You need to provide the namespace as a parameter.\n3. Summarize\\_Services\\_Information\\_In\\_OpenShift\\_Namespace: This tool summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. You need to provide the namespace as a parameter.\n4. List\\_Prometheus\\_Metrics\\_Names\\_Using\\_A\\_Filter: This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. You need to provide the Prometheus service name, namespace, port, query target name, and query target value as parameters.\n5. List\\_metric\\_values\\_between\\_a\\_timestamp\\_range: This tool lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. You need to provide the Prometheus service name, namespace, port, metric name, metric range start, and metric range end as parameters.\n6. Get\\_timestamp\\_and\\_time\\_ISO: This tool calculates the timestamp, the ISO formatted string, and the timezone string of the requested time information. You need to provide the time value, time metric, and ago flag as parameters.\n7. File\\_create\\_plot\\_irate: This tool creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. You need to provide the Prometheus service name, namespace, port, metric name, metric range start, and metric range end as parameters.\n8. MLASP\\_generate\\_config: This tool generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. You need to provide the epochs, KPI value, and precision as parameters.\n9. RAG\\_tool: This tool is used when searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. You need to provide the query as a parameter.", "total_tokens": 3021, "total_time_seconds": 7.34883975982666, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
