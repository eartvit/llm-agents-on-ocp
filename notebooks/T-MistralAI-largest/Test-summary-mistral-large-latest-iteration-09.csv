Q-09,7065,24.20852041244507,"I found the following information:

My Storage
 - Use this bucket for storing your models and data. You can reuse this bucket and
its connection for your notebooks and model servers.
Pipelines Artifacts
 - Use this bucket as storage for your pipeline artifacts. A pipeline artifacts
bucket is required when you create a pipeline server. For this tutorial, create this bucket to
separate it from the first storage bucket for clarity.
You can use your own storage buckets or run a provided script that creates local Minio storage buckets
for you.
Also, you must create a data connection to each storage bucket. A data connection is a resource that
contains the configuration parameters needed to connect to an object storage bucket.
You have two options for this tutorial, depending on whether you want to use your own storage buckets
or use a script to create local Minio storage buckets:
If you want to use your own S3-compatible object storage buckets, create data connections to
CHAPTER 2. SETTING UP A PROJECT AND STORAGE

Repeat those steps to create as many buckets as you will need.

Create a matching Data Connection for Minio

Back in RHOAI, inside of your Data Science Project, Click on Add data connection:

Then, fill out the required field to match with your newly-deployed Minio Object Storage

You now have a Data Connection that maps to your mybucket bucket in your Minio Instance.

This data connection can be used, among other things
In your Workbenches
For your Model Serving
For your Pipeline Server Configuration

Validate
To test if everything is working correctly, you can access the workbench associated with your Data Connection and run the following commands (i.e., inside a Jupyter notebook):

Install and import MinIO Python Client SDK
!pip install minio

from minio import Minio
from minio.error import S3Error
import  os
import datetime

d

.
In the
Bucket
 field, enter the name of your S3-compatible object storage bucket.
IMPORTANT
If you specify incorrect data connection settings, you cannot update these
settings on the same pipeline server. Therefore, you must delete the pipeline
server and configure another one.

In the
Database
 section, click

store your pipeline data and select one of the following sets of actions:
Select

 to deploy a MariaDB database in your
project.
Select
Connect to external MySQL database
 to add a new connection to an external
database that your pipeline server can access.

NOTE
After the pipeline server is created, the

 folders are automatically
created in the default
root

directories when configuring a data connection for your pipeline server.
Prerequisites
You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
You have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.
If you are using specialized OpenShift AI groups, you are part of the user group or admin group
(for example,
rhoai-users

You have created a data science project that you can add a pipeline server to.
You have an existing S3-compatible object storage bucket and you have configured write
