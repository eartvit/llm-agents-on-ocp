This configuration is expected to provide a throughput KPI of approximately 309.85, which is very close to your target of 307 and well within the 2.9% precision boundary you specified.

To implement this configuration in WireMock, you would need to set these parameters accordingly in your WireMock setup. The exact method for setting these parameters may depend on how you're using WireMock (e.g., programmatically or via configuration files), but these values should give you a good starting point for achieving your desired throughput KPI.

Yes, there is a Prometheus service running in the ""demo"" namespace. Here are the details:

Name: prometheus-operated
Port values:
1. Port: 9090, Name: web, Protocol: TCP
2. Port: 10901, Name: grpc, Protocol: TCP

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports configured:
1. The main web interface is accessible on port 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC port configured on 10901.

It's worth noting that there's no route information available for this service, which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the services in the ""demo"" namespace or the Prometheus service specifically?",34744,16.10970425605774,"Great! I've successfully retrieved the information you requested. Let me summarize the findings for you:

1. Prometheus Service Information:
   - Service Name: prometheus-operated
   - Port: 9090 (web port)
   - Namespace: demo

2. List of Metrics:
I've retrieved a comprehensive list of metrics available for the namespace ""demo"". There are numerous metrics available, covering various aspects of the system and applications. Some of the notable categories of metrics include:

- Node-specific metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process-related metrics
- Prometheus-specific metrics
- Application-specific metrics (e.g., WireMock, load generator)

Here are some examples of the types of metrics available:

a. System metrics:
   - node_cpu_seconds_total
   - node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
   - node_disk_io_time_seconds_total
   - node_network_receive_bytes_total

b. Application metrics:
   - load_generator_1xx_msg
   - load_generator_2xx_msg
   - load_generator_avg_latency_ms
   - wiremock_requests_total

c. Prometheus-specific metrics:
   - promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total
   - scrape_duration_seconds

d. Process metrics:
   - process_cpu_seconds_total
   - process_open_fds

These metrics can be used to monitor various aspects of your system and applications running in the ""demo"" namespace. You can use these metrics to create dashboards, set up alerts, or perform further analysis of your OpenShift environment.

Is there any specific category of metrics you'd like more information about, or would you like to explore any particular metric in more detail?",34895,17.383960723876953,"Now, I'll summarize the information for you:

1. Prometheus Service Information:
   - Service Name: prometheus-operated
   - Namespace: demo
   - Port: 9090 (web)

2. Metrics starting with ""load_generator"":
   - load_generator_1xx_msg
   - load_generator_2xx_msg
   - load_generator_3xx_msg
   - load_generator_4xx_msg
   - load_generator_5xx_msg

   - load_generator_spike_other_msg
   - load_generator_spike_total_msg
   - load_generator_system_load_average
   - load_generator_total_msg

These metrics seem to be related to a load generator application, providing information about HTTP status codes, latency, and various load-related statistics. The metrics include both regular and ""spike"" scenarios, which might be used to simulate different load patterns or stress tests.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about these metrics or the Prometheus setup in the demo namespace?",6573,10.896251440048218,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with a configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified 2.9 percent precision. Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 0.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 28
3. cThreads: 272
4. jacptQSize: 1768
5. jacptThreads: 239
6. ltTargetSize: 14
7. numConnections: 30
8. timeoutSeconds: 1

This configuration is predicted to achieve a throughput KPI of approximately 310.63, which is within the 2.9% precision you specified. The actual deviation from the target KPI of 307 is about 1.18%, which is well within the acceptable range.

To break it down:
- The configuration uses no asynchronous responses (asyncResp: 0.0)
- It utilizes 28 asynchronous response threads
- The number of client threads (cThreads) is set to 272
- The Jetty acceptor queue size (jacptQSize) is set to 1768
- There are 239 Jetty acceptor threads (jacptThreads)
- The listener target size (ltTargetSize) is set to 14
- The number of connections (numConnections) is set to 30
- The timeout is set to 1 second

This configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving the desired throughput KPI of 307 requests per second.

- Asynchronous response is turned off (asyncResp = 0.0)
- 27 threads are allocated for asynchronous responses (asyncRespThreads = 27)
- 206 threads are used for processing (cThreads = 206)
- The accept queue size is set to 1305 (jacptQSize = 1305)

- The target size for long-term tasks is set to 7 (ltTargetSize = 7)
- The number of connections is set to 33 (numConnections = 33)
- The timeout is set to 4 seconds (timeoutSeconds = 4)

The tool searched for 100 epochs as requested and found a configuration that meets the criteria.

Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 0.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 8
3. cThreads: 192
4. jacptQSize: 1819
5. jacptThreads: 232
6. ltTargetSize: 5
7. numConnections: 34
8. timeoutSeconds: 5

This configuration is predicted to achieve a KPI value of 311.12, which is within the specified precision of 2.9% from the target value of 307. The actual deviation is about 1.34%, which is well within the acceptable range.

To break it down:
- Asynchronous response is turned off (asyncResp: 0.0)
- 8 threads are allocated for asynchronous responses (asyncRespThreads: 8)
- 192 threads are used for general processing (cThreads: 192)
- The Jetty acceptor queue size is set to 1819 (jacptQSize: 1819)
- 232 threads are allocated for Jetty acceptors (jacptThreads: 232)
- The listen thread target size is set to 5 (ltTargetSize: 5)
- 34 connections are allowed (numConnections: 34)
- The timeout is set to 5 seconds (timeoutSeconds: 5)

1. Name: prometheus-operated
2. Ports:
   - Port: 9090, Name: web, Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 10901, Name: grpc, Protocol: TCP

Here's a summary of what we did:

1. We found the Prometheus service information in the ""demo"" namespace:
   - Service name: prometheus-operated
   - Port: 9090 (web)

2. We used this information to retrieve the list of metrics filtered by namespace ""demo"".

The list of metrics is quite extensive, with 415 different metrics available. These metrics cover various aspects of the system, including:

1. Application-specific metrics (e.g., load_generator_*)
2. Node-level metrics (e.g., node_cpu_*, node_memory_*, node_network_*)
3. Process-level metrics (e.g., process_cpu_seconds_total, process_open_fds)
4. Prometheus-specific metrics (e.g., promhttp_*)
5. System-level metrics (e.g., system_load_average)

Some interesting metrics that might be useful for monitoring the demo namespace include:

1. load_generator_* metrics: These seem to be custom metrics related to a load generation application, which could be useful for monitoring performance under different load conditions.

2. node_cpu_* and node_memory_* metrics: These provide information about CPU and memory usage on the nodes, which can help monitor resource utilization.

3. node_network_* metrics: These metrics provide information about network activity, which can be useful for monitoring network performance and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

4. process_* metrics: These metrics provide information about the processes running in the namespace, which can help monitor resource usage at the process level.

I've successfully retrieved the information about the Prometheus service and the metrics that start with ""load_generator"" in the ""demo"" namespace. Let me summarize the findings for you:

1. Prometheus Service Information:
   - Service Name: prometheus-operated

22. load_generator_spike_other_msg
23. load_generator_spike_total_msg
24. load_generator_system_load_average
25. load_generator_total_msg

These metrics seem to be related to a load generator application, providing information about HTTP response codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx), average latency, and various spike-related metrics. They cover both normal operation and spike scenarios, giving a comprehensive view of the load generator's performance and the responses it receives.

Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 1.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 19
3. cThreads: 251
4. jacptQSize: 1009
5. jacptThreads: 259
6. ltTargetSize: 15
7. numConnections: 32
8. timeoutSeconds: 5

This configuration is predicted to achieve a KPI value of approximately 312.60, which is within the specified precision of 2.9% from the target value of 307. The actual deviation is about 1.82%, which is well within the acceptable range.

To break it down:
- The asynchronous response is enabled (asyncResp = 1.0)
- 19 threads are allocated for asynchronous responses
- 251 threads are allocated for client connections
- The Jetty acceptor queue size is set to 1009
- 259 threads are allocated for Jetty acceptors
- The load test target size is set to 15
- The number of connections is set to 32
- The timeout is set to 5 seconds

This configuration should provide a good balance of performance parameters to achieve the desired throughput KPI of around 307, with the actual prediction being slightly higher at 312.60, but still within the acceptable precision range.",17391,10.834188222885132,FILE-plot-load_generator_total_msg-1724387651-1727843652.png,84136,32.13677930831909,"Now that we have the metric data, let's present it as a CSV table with timestamps and metric values.

To break it down:
- The asynchronous response is enabled (asyncResp = 1.0) with 6 asynchronous response threads.
- The number of client threads (cThreads) is set to 220.
- The Jetty acceptor queue size (jacptQSize) is set to 1210.

- The load test target size (ltTargetSize) is 14.
- The number of connections (numConnections) is set to 31.

Is there any specific information about these pods or services you'd like me to elaborate on?",6548,10.733434915542603,"Great! I have the summary of the pods in the ""demo"" namespace. Let me break it down for you:

1. Namespace: demo

2. Pod States:
   a. Succeeded: 121 pods
   b. Running: 4 pods

3. Details of Running Pods:

   3.1. Pod: grafana-demo-deployment-76bf8c67d5-rf2ht

   - Route: unavailable

In summary, the ""demo"" namespace has a total of 125 pods:
- 121 pods have completed their execution successfully (Succeeded state)
- 4 pods are currently running

The running pods include Grafana, InfluxDB, Prometheus Operator, and Prometheus instances. Most of these have associated services, but none of them have available routes, which means they might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration.

   - File system: e.g., node_filesystem_avail_bytes, node_filesystem_size_bytes

b. Process-related metrics:
   - e.g., process_cpu_seconds_total, process_open_fds, process_resident_memory_bytes

c. Prometheus-specific metrics:
   - e.g., promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total, scrape_duration_seconds

d. Application-specific metrics:
   - e.g., load_generator_avg_latency_ms, load_generator_2xx_msg, load_generator_4xx_msg

e. System-level metrics:
   - e.g., node_load1, node_load5, node_load15 (system load averages)

f. JVM-related metrics (indicating Java applications):
   - e.g., jvm_memory_bytes_used, jvm_threads_current

g. Network protocol metrics:
   - e.g., node_netstat_Tcp_InSegs, node_netstat_Udp_InDatagrams

These metrics provide a wide range of information about the system, applications, and network performance in the ""demo"" namespace. They can be used for monitoring, alerting, and analyzing the behavior of your OpenShift cluster and the applications running within it.

Is there any specific category of metrics or particular metric you'd like more information about?",34837,18.43672251701355,"Great!

22. load_generator_spike_other_msg
23. load_generator_spike_total_msg
24. load_generator_system_load_average
25. load_generator_total_msg

These metrics seem to be related to a load generator application, capturing various HTTP status codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx), latency, and message counts. There are also metrics for ""spike"" and ""spike_cycle"" events, which might indicate periods of increased load or specific test scenarios.

We have successfully generated a configuration for WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified precision. Let me break down the results for you:

1. Predicted KPI Value: 312.15
2. Deviation from target: 1.68% (which is within the 2.9% precision you specified)

Here's the configuration of WireMock parameters that supports this KPI:

This configuration is predicted to deliver a throughput KPI of approximately 312.15, which is within 1.68% of your target KPI of 307. This is well within the 2.9% precision you specified.

To implement this configuration in WireMock, you would need to set these parameters accordingly in your WireMock setup. The exact method for setting these parameters may depend on how you're using WireMock (e.g., via Java API, JSON configuration, or command-line options).

   b. Optionally, you can edit the resource name. If you do, remember that it must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
   c. Enter a description for your data science project.

5. Click the ""Create"" button.

After creation, a project details page will open. From this page, you can enhance your project by:
- Creating workbenches
- Adding cluster storage and data connections
- Importing pipelines
- Deploying models

To verify that your project was created successfully, you should see it listed on the Data Science Projects page.

It's worth noting that a data science project in OpenShift AI helps you organize your work in one place and provides access to various components such as:
- Workbenches
- Storage for your project's cluster
- Data connections
- Model servers

This structure allows you to manage all aspects of your data science workflow within a single project environment.
