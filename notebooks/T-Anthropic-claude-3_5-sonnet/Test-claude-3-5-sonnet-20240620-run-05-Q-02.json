{"final_response": "I have access to several tools that can help with various tasks related to OpenShift, Prometheus, and Red Hat OpenShift AI. Here's a summary of the available tools:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators: Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Provides a summary of pods information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: Lists application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: Calculates the timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string of the requested time information.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values between a start and end timestamp interval.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config: Generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary.\n\n9. RAG_tool: Used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nThese tools can help with various tasks related to OpenShift cluster management, monitoring with Prometheus, time-related calculations, and even some machine learning tasks.
