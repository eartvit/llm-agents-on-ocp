1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.

2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on ""Data Science Projects"".

3. On the Data Science Projects page, click ""Create data science project"".

4. In the ""Create a data science project"" dialog:
   - Enter a name for your project.
   - Optionally, edit the resource name (must be lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens allowed, and start/end with alphanumeric character).
   - Enter a description for your project.

5. Click ""Create"".

After creation, you'll be taken to the project details page. From there, you can:

Paris is the capital and largest city of France, known for its iconic landmarks, rich history, and cultural significance. It's often called the ""City of Light"" and is famous for attractions like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and Champs-Élysées. Paris is renowned for its art, fashion, cuisine, and romantic atmosphere. The city is divided into 20 arrondissements (districts) and is bisected by the River Seine. With its beautiful architecture, world-class museums, charming cafes, and vibrant neighborhoods, Paris remains one of the most visited and beloved cities in the world.

1. 9090 (name: web, protocol: TCP)
2. 10901 (name: grpc, protocol: TCP)

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports:
1. The main web interface port is 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC port at 10901.

It's worth noting that the route for this service is listed as ""unavailable,"" which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration."

1. Prometheus Service Information:
   - Service Name: prometheus-operated
   - Port: 9090 (web interface and API)

2. Metrics:
   The query returned a large number of metrics available for the ""demo"" namespace. These metrics cover various aspects of the system, including:

   - Node-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Process-level metrics
   - Prometheus-specific metrics
   - Custom application metrics (e.g., load_generator metrics)

Some notable metrics that might be of interest for monitoring the ""demo"" namespace include:

1. Load Generator Metrics:
   - load_generator_1xx_msg, load_generator_2xx_msg, load_generator_3xx_msg, load_generator_4xx_msg, load_generator_5xx_msg
   - load_generator_avg_latency_ms
   - load_generator_total_msg
   - load_generator_spike_* (various spike-related metrics)

2. Node Metrics:
   - node_cpu_* (CPU-related metrics)
   - node_memory_* (memory-related metrics)
   - node_disk_* (disk-related metrics)
   - node_network_* (network-related metrics)

3. Process Metrics:
   - process_cpu_seconds_total
   - process_open_fds
   - process_resident_memory_bytes
   - process_virtual_memory_bytes

4. JVM Metrics (if Java applications are running):
   - jvm_memory_bytes_used
   - jvm_threads_current
   - jvm_gc_collection_seconds_count

5. Prometheus-specific Metrics:
   - promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total
   - scrape_duration_seconds
   - up (indicates if a target is up or down)

These metrics can provide valuable insights into the performance and health of your applications and infrastructure in the ""demo"" namespace. You can use these metrics to create dashboards, set up alerts, and monitor the overall state of your system.

Is there any specific aspect of the system or particular metrics you'd like to focus on or explore further?"
Q-22,34788,16.594849824905396,"Great! I've retrieved the information about the Prometheus service and the metrics that start with ""load_generator"" in the ""demo"" namespace. Let me summarize the findings for you:

2. Metrics starting with ""load_generator"":

1. load_generator_1xx_msg
2. load_generator_2xx_msg

20. load_generator_spike_cycle_other_msg
21. load_generator_spike_cycle_total_msg
22. load_generator_spike_other_msg
23. load_generator_spike_total_msg
24. load_generator_system_load_average
25. load_generator_total_msg

These metrics seem to be related to a load generator application, capturing various HTTP response codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx), latency, and total message counts. Some metrics are specific to ""spike"" and ""spike_cycle"" scenarios, which might indicate different load testing patterns.

Is there any specific information about these metrics you'd like to explore further?"
Q-23,6599,10.965502262115479,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with the configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI of approximately 307 within the 2.9 percent precision you requested. Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 0.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 27
3. cThreads: 206
4. jacptQSize: 1305
5. jacptThreads: 271
6. ltTargetSize: 7
7. numConnections: 33
8. timeoutSeconds: 4

This configuration is predicted to achieve a KPI value of 307.55, which is within the requested precision. The deviation from the target KPI is approximately 0.18%, which is well within the 2.9% precision you specified.

To break it down:
- Asynchronous response is turned off (asyncResp = 0.0)
- 27 threads are allocated for asynchronous responses (asyncRespThreads = 27)
- 206 threads are used for processing (cThreads = 206)
- The accept queue size is set to 1305 (jacptQSize = 1305)
- 271 threads are allocated for accepting connections (jacptThreads = 271)
- The target size for long-term tasks is set to 7 (ltTargetSize = 7)
- The number of connections is set to 33 (numConnections = 33)
- The timeout is set to 4 seconds (timeoutSeconds = 4)

This configuration should provide a throughput very close to your desired KPI of 307, with a high degree of precision. The actual performance may vary slightly in real-world conditions, but this setup is expected to be very close to your target based on the model's predictions."
