Q-15,6175,5.691199779510498,"Based on the information retrieved, I can answer your question about the Prometheus service in the ""demo"" namespace.

Yes, there is a Prometheus service running in the ""demo"" namespace. Here are the details:

Name: prometheus-operated
Port values:
1. Port: 9090, Name: web, Protocol: TCP
2. Port: 10901, Name: grpc, Protocol: TCP

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports configured:
1. The main web interface is accessible on port 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC port configured on 10901.

It's worth noting that there's no route information available for this service, which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the services in the ""demo"" namespace or the Prometheus service specifically?"
Q-16,34744,16.10970425605774,"Great! I've successfully retrieved the information you requested. Let me summarize the findings for you:

1. Prometheus Service Information:
   - Service Name: prometheus-operated
   - Port: 9090 (web port)
   - Namespace: demo

2. List of Metrics:
I've retrieved a comprehensive list of metrics available for the namespace ""demo"". There are numerous metrics available, covering various aspects of the system and applications. Some of the notable categories of metrics include:

- Node-specific metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process-related metrics
- Prometheus-specific metrics
- Application-specific metrics (e.g., WireMock, load generator)

Here are some examples of the types of metrics available:

a. System metrics:
   - node_cpu_seconds_total
   - node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
   - node_disk_io_time_seconds_total
   - node_network_receive_bytes_total

b. Application metrics:
   - load_generator_1xx_msg
   - load_generator_2xx_msg
   - load_generator_avg_latency_ms
   - wiremock_requests_total

c. Prometheus-specific metrics:
   - promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total
   - scrape_duration_seconds

d. Process metrics:
   - process_cpu_seconds_total
   - process_open_fds

These metrics can be used to monitor various aspects of your system and applications running in the ""demo"" namespace. You can use these metrics to create dashboards, set up alerts, or perform further analysis of your OpenShift environment.

Is there any specific category of metrics you'd like more information about, or would you like to explore any particular metric in more detail?"
Q-17,34895,17.383960723876953,"Now, I'll summarize the information for you:

   - load_generator_spike_other_msg
   - load_generator_spike_total_msg
   - load_generator_system_load_average
   - load_generator_total_msg

These metrics seem to be related to a load generator application, providing information about HTTP status codes, latency, and various load-related statistics. The metrics include both regular and ""spike"" scenarios, which might be used to simulate different load patterns or stress tests.

Q-18,6573,10.896251440048218,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with a configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified 2.9 percent precision. Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 0.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 28
3. cThreads: 272
4. jacptQSize: 1768
5. jacptThreads: 239
6. ltTargetSize: 14
7. numConnections: 30
8. timeoutSeconds: 1

This configuration is predicted to achieve a throughput KPI of approximately 310.63, which is within the 2.9% precision you specified. The actual deviation from the target KPI of 307 is about 1.18%, which is well within the acceptable range.

To break it down:
- The configuration uses no asynchronous responses (asyncResp: 0.0)
- It utilizes 28 asynchronous response threads
- The number of client threads (cThreads) is set to 272
- The Jetty acceptor queue size (jacptQSize) is set to 1768
- There are 239 Jetty acceptor threads (jacptThreads)
- The listener target size (ltTargetSize) is set to 14
- The number of connections (numConnections) is set to 30
- The timeout is set to 1 second

This configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving the desired throughput KPI of 307 requests per second. You may want to test this configuration in your specific environment and make minor adjustments if necessary, but it should be very close to meeting your performance requirements."
