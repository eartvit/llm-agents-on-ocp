{"final_response": "Thank you for providing that information. I'll now explain how to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI based on the details retrieved.\n\nTo create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\n2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on \"Data Science Projects\".\n\n3. On the Data Science Projects page, click the \"Create data science project\" button.\n\n4. In the \"Create a data science project\" dialog that opens, you'll need to provide the following information:\n   - Name: Enter a name for your data science project.\n   - Resource name: This is optional. If you don't specify one, it will be automatically generated based on the project name. If you choose to edit it, remember that it must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.\n   - Description: Enter a description for your project.\n\n5. After filling in the required information, click the \"Create\" button.\n\n6. A project details page will open. From this page, you can enhance your project by adding various components such as:\n   - Workbenches\n   - Cluster storage\n   - Data connections\n   - Pipelines (you can import these)\n   - Model servers (for deploying models)\n\nTo verify that your project has been created successfully, you should see it listed on the \"Data science projects\" page.\n\nIt's worth noting that creating a Data Science Project in OpenShift AI provides you with a centralized place to organize your work and access various data science tools and resources. This project structure allows you to manage different aspects of your data science workflow efficiently, from data storage and processing to model development and deployment.\n\nIs there anything specific about the Data Science Project creation process you'd like more information on, or would you like to know more about any of the components you can add to your project?", "total_tokens": 7250, "total_time_seconds": 8.46520709991455, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "How to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI"}, "id": "toolu_01DzMxgppG2p6HJ1BvmpfvqB", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01DzMxgppG2p6HJ1BvmpfvqB": "Procedure\n1\n. \nFrom the OpenShift AI dashboard, click \nData Science Projects\n.\nThe \nData science projects\n page opens.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\nThe \nCreate a data science project\n dialog opens.\n3\n. \nEnter a \nname\n for your data science project.\n4\n. \nOptional: Edit the \nresource name\n for your data science project.

Updating a data science project\nYou can update your data science project\u2019s details by changing your project\u2019s name and description text.\nPrerequisites\nYou have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nCHAPTER 4. CREATING A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT\nTo start your data science work, create a data science project. Creating a project helps you organize your\nwork in one place. You can also enhance your data science project by adding the following functionality:\nWorkbenches\nStorage for your project\u2019s cluster\nData connections\nModel servers\nPrerequisites\nYou have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\nIf you are using specialized OpenShift AI groups, you are part of the user group or admin group\n(for example, \nrhoai-users\n or \nrhoai-admins\n ) in OpenShift.\nProcedure\n1\n. \nFrom the OpenShift AI dashboard, click \nData Science Projects\n.\nThe \nData science projects\n page opens.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\nThe \nCreate a data science project\n dialog opens.\n3\n. \nEnter a \nname\n for your data science project.\n4\n. \nOptional: Edit the \nresource name\n for your data science project. The resource name must\nconsist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, \n-\n, and must start and end with an alphanumeric\ncharacter.\n5\n. \nEnter a\n\n1\n. \nOn the navigation menu, select \nData Science Projects\n.
