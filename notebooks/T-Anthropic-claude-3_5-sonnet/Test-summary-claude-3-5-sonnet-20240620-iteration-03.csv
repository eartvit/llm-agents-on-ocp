Q-05,7152,7.108140707015991,"Thank you for providing that information. I'll summarize the steps to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.

2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on ""Data Science Projects"".

3. On the Data Science Projects page, click ""Create data science project"".

4. In the ""Create a data science project"" dialog:
   - Enter a name for your project.
   - Optionally, edit the resource name (must be lowercase alphanumeric characters, can include hyphens, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character).
   - Enter a description for your project.

5. Click ""Create"".

After creation, you'll be taken to the project details page. From there, you can enhance your data science project by adding:
- Workbenches
- Cluster storage
- Data connections
- Pipelines (import)
- Models (deploy)

To verify that your project was created successfully, you should see it listed on the ""Data science projects"" page.

It's worth noting that if you're using specialized OpenShift AI groups, you need to be part of the user group or admin group (e.g., 'rhoai-users' or 'rhoai-admins') in OpenShift to create a project.

Is there anything specific about creating a Data Science Project that you'd like more information on?"

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports:
1. The main web interface port is 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC port at 10901.

It's worth noting that while the service exists, the route is listed as 'unavailable', which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration."

2. List of Metrics:
The function call returned a large number of metrics available in the ""demo"" namespace. Here are some notable categories of metrics:

a) Node metrics:
   - CPU usage (e.g., node_cpu_seconds_total)
   - Memory usage (e.g., node_memory_MemTotal_bytes, node_memory_MemFree_bytes)
   - Disk usage (e.g., node_disk_read_bytes_total, node_disk_written_bytes_total)
   - Network usage (e.g., node_network_receive_bytes_total, node_network_transmit_bytes_total)
   - System load (e.g., node_load1, node_load5, node_load15)

b) Process metrics:
   - CPU usage (e.g., process_cpu_seconds_total)
   - Memory usage (e.g., process_resident_memory_bytes, process_virtual_memory_bytes)
   - File descriptors (e.g., process_open_fds, process_max_fds)

c) Prometheus-specific metrics:
   - Scrape metrics (e.g., scrape_duration_seconds, scrape_samples_scraped)
   - HTTP handler metrics (e.g., promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total)

d) Custom application metrics:
   - Load generator metrics (e.g., load_generator_1xx_msg, load_generator_2xx_msg, load_generator_avg_latency_ms)
   - WireMock metrics (e.g., wiremock_requests_total, wiremock_requests_created)

e) System-level metrics:
   - File system metrics (e.g., node_filesystem_avail_bytes, node_filesystem_size_bytes)
   - Network stack metrics (e.g., node_netstat_Tcp_CurrEstab, node_netstat_Udp_InDatagrams)

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the system, including hardware resources, network activity, and application-specific performance indicators. They can be used for monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis of the applications and infrastructure in the ""demo"" namespace.

22. load_generator_spike_other_msg
23. load_generator_spike_total_msg
24. load_generator_system_load_average
25. load_generator_total_msg

Q-18,6526,10.250279903411863,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with a WireMock configuration that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the 2.9 percent precision you specified. Here's the configuration:

4. jacptQSize: 1362
5. jacptThreads: 117

This configuration is predicted to achieve a throughput KPI of approximately 310.07, which is within the 2.9% precision range you specified. The actual deviation from the target KPI of 307 is about 0.9998%, which is well within your desired precision.

To break it down:
- Asynchronous response is turned off (asyncResp: 0.0)
- 21 asynchronous response threads
- 127 client threads
- Jetty acceptor queue size of 1362
- 117 Jetty acceptor threads
- Long-term target size of 5
- 32 connections
- A timeout of 2 seconds

This configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving your desired throughput KPI. Keep in mind that actual performance may vary depending on the specific environment and workload, so you might need to fine-tune these parameters in your actual setup."
