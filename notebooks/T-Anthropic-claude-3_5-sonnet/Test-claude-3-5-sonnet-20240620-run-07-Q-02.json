{"final_response": "As an AI assistant, I have access to several tools that can help me provide information and perform various tasks related to OpenShift, Prometheus, and machine learning. Here's a list of the tools I can use:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators: This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: This tool lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: This tool calculates the timestamp, the ISO formatted string, and the timezone string of the requested time information.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate: This tool creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config: This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary.\n\n9. RAG_tool: This tool is used when searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nThese tools allow me to gather information about OpenShift environments, work with Prometheus metrics, perform time-related calculations, create plots, generate configurations for machine learning, and search for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. Is there a specific task or question you'd like help with using these tools?", "total_tokens": 3217, "total_time_seconds": 6.831992149353027, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
