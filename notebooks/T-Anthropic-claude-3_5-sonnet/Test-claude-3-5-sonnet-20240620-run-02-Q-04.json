{"final_response": "Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with a list and brief description of the tools I have access to. Here they are:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators\n   Description: This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. It provides details such as name, namespace, version, and status of available operators.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace\n   Description: This tool summarizes pod information in an OpenShift namespace. It provides details about pod states, counts, and for running pods, it includes service information if available.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace\n   Description: This tool summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. It provides a list of available services and their properties such as name, port numbers, and route information.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter\n   Description: This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. It's useful for discovering metrics based on specific criteria.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range\n   Description: This tool retrieves metric values and associated timestamps for a specific metric name within a given time range from a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO\n   Description: This tool calculates timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string based on a given time input. It can handle relative time expressions like \"4 hours from now\" or \"3 hours ago\".\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate\n   Description: This tool creates a file with a plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric's values over a specified time range. The data is retrieved from a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config\n   Description: This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. It uses machine learning to search for optimal configurations.\n\n9. RAG_tool\n   Description: This tool is specifically used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. It uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to provide relevant information based on a given query.\n\nThese tools cover a range of functionalities from OpenShift cluster management to metrics analysis and machine learning-based configuration generation. They can be very helpful in managing and analyzing OpenShift environments, working with Prometheus metrics, and exploring Red Hat OpenShift AI capabilities.", "total_tokens": 3340, "total_time_seconds": 9.038357257843018, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
