The MLASP_generate_config tool has provided us with a configuration for WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified precision. Let me break down the results for you:\n\n1. Predicted KPI value: 309.85 (which is within 2.9% of the target 307)\n2. Deviation: 0.93% (well within the 2.9% precision you requested)\n\nHere's the configuration of WireMock parameters that supports this KPI:\n\n1. asyncResp: 1.0\n2. asyncRespThreads: 11\n3. cThreads: 247\n4. jacptQSize: 1660\n5. jacptThreads: 136\n6. ltTargetSize: 6\n7. numConnections: 30\n8. timeoutSeconds: 3\n\nThis configuration is expected to provide a throughput KPI of approximately 309.85, which is very close to your target of 307 and well within the 2.9% precision boundary you specified.\n\nTo implement this configuration in WireMock, you would need to set these parameters accordingly in your WireMock setup. The exact method for setting these parameters may depend on how you're using WireMock (e.g., programmatically or via configuration files), but these values should give you a good starting point for achieving your desired throughput KPI.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this configuration or WireMock in general?""}","{'total_tokens': 17461, 'total_time_seconds': 11.143733024597168, 'final_response': 'FILE-plot-load_generator_total_msg-1724379617-1727835618.png'}","{'total_tokens': 84111, 'total_time_seconds': 31.637987852096558, 'final_response': ""Now that we have the data, I'll create a CSV table with the metric values and their associated timestamps.

This is well within the specified precision of 2.9%.\n\nTo break it down:\n- The prediction (304.45) is very close to the desired KPI value (307).\n- The deviation is about 0.83%, which is significantly better than the requested 2.9% precision.\n\nThis configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving the desired throughput KPI in WireMock. You may want to test this configuration in your actual environment to verify its performance, as real-world results may vary slightly from the prediction.""}","{'total_tokens': 17343, 'total_time_seconds': 10.394883155822754, 'final_response': 'FILE-plot-load_generator_total_msg-1724391669-1727847668.png'}","{'total_tokens': 84155, 'total_time_seconds': 31.448389530181885, 'final_response': ""Now, let's print out the metric values and their associated timestamps as a CSV table:\n\nTimestamp,Metric Value\n1727411464.572,75.0\n1727411469.572,222.0\n1727411474.572,362.0\n1727411479.572,500.0\n1727411484.572,639.0\n1727411489.572,778.0\n1727411494.572,918.0\n1727411499.572,1060.0\n1727411504.572,1199.0\n1727411509.572,1338.0\n1727411514.572,1483.0\n1727411519.572,1619.0\n1727411524.572,1760.0\n1727411529.572,1897.0\n1727411534.572,2038.0\n1727411539.572,2181.0\n1727411544.572,2322.0\n1727411549.572,2459.0\n1727411554.572,2596.0\n1727411559.572,2732.0\n1727411564.572,2865.0\n1727411569.572,2998.0\n1727411574.572,3126.0\n1727411579.572,3253.0\n1727411584.572,3382.0\n1727411589.572,3509.0\n1727411594.572,3640.0\n1727411599.572,3766.0\n1727411604.572,3890.0\n1727411609.572,4021.0\n1727411614.572,4148.0\n1727411619.572,4280.0\n1727411624.572,4408.0\n1727411629.572,4540.0\n1727411634.572,4667.0\n1727411639.572,4793.0\n1727411644.572,4924.0\n1727411649.572,5052.0\n1727411654.572,5180.0\n1727411659.572,5307.0\n1727411664.572,5429.0\n1727411669.572,5550.0\n1727411674.572,5674.0\n1727411679.572,5798.0\n1727411684.572,5921.0\n1727411689.572,6048.0\n1727411694.572,6170.0\n1727411699.572,6293.0\n1727411704.572,6414.0\n1727411709.572,6540.0\n1727411714.572,6661.0\n1727411719.572,6783.0\n1727411724.572,6910.0\n1727411729.572,7035.0\n1727411734.572,7155.0\n1727411739.572,7276.0\n1727411744.572,7400.0\n1727411749.572,7526.0\n1727411754.572,7647.0\n1727411759.572,7770.0\n1727411764.572,7889.0\n1727411769.572,8003.0\n1727411774.572,8122.0\n1727411779.572,8237.0\n1727411784.572,8355.0\n1727411789.572,8472.0\n1727411794.572,8591.0\n1727411799.572,8709.0\n1727411804.572,8827.0\n1727411809.572,8946.0\n1727411814.572,9062.0\n1727411819.572,9180.0\n1727411824.572,9300.0\n1727411829.572,9419.0\n1727411834.572,9535.0\n1727411839.572,9652.0\n1727411844.572,9770.0\n1727411849.572,9884.0\n1727411854.572,9994.0\n1727411859.572,10104.0\n1727411864.572,10216.0\n1727411869.572,10332.0\n1727411874.572,10442.0\n1727411879.572,10""}"
