{"final_response": "Great! I have retrieved the summary of pods in the \"demo\" namespace. Let me break down the information for you:\n\n1. Namespace: demo\n\n2. Pod States:\n   a. Succeeded Pods:\n      - Count: 121\n      - No running pods in this state (as expected for succeeded pods)\n\n   b. Running Pods:\n      - Count: 4\n      - Details of running pods:\n\n        1. Pod Name: grafana-demo-deployment-76bf8c67d5-rf2ht\n           - Associated Service: grafana-demo-service\n           - Port: 3000\n           - Port Name: grafana\n           - Protocol: TCP\n           - Route: unavailable\n\n        2.
