{"final_response": "Based on the information retrieved, I can guide you through the process of creating a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\n2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on \"Data Science Projects\".\n\n3. On the Data Science Projects page, click the \"Create data science project\" button.\n\n4. In the \"Create a data science project\" dialog that opens, you'll need to provide the following information:\n\n   a. Enter a name for your data science project.\n   b. Optionally, you can edit the resource name. If you do, remember that it must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.\n   c. Enter a description for your data science project.\n\n5. Click the \"Create\" button.\n\nAfter creation, a project details page will open. From this page, you can enhance your project by:\n- Creating workbenches\n- Adding cluster storage and data connections\n- Importing pipelines\n- Deploying models\n\nTo verify that your project was created successfully, you should see it listed on the Data Science Projects page.\n\nIt's worth noting that a data science project in OpenShift AI helps you organize your work in one place and provides access to various components such as:\n- Workbenches\n- Storage for your project's cluster\n- Data connections\n- Model servers\n\nThis structure allows you to manage all aspects of your data science workflow within a single project environment.\n\nIs there any specific aspect of creating or setting up your Data Science Project that you'd like more information about?", "total_tokens": 7206, "total_time_seconds": 7.8928680419921875, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "How to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI"}, "id": "toolu_01VojCErGXKPWrCQpCX2gui9", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01VojCErGXKPWrCQpCX2gui9": "Procedure\n1\n. \nFrom the OpenShift AI dashboard, click \nData Science Projects\n.\nThe \nData science projects\n page opens.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\nThe \nCreate a data science project\n dialog opens.\n3\n. \nEnter a \nname\n for your data science project.\n4\n. \nOptional: Edit the \nresource name\n for your data science project.

Updating a data science project\nYou can update your data science project\u2019s details by changing your project\u2019s name and description text.\nPrerequisites\nYou have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nCHAPTER 4. CREATING A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT\nTo start your data science work, create a data science project. Creating a project helps you organize your\nwork in one place. You can also enhance your data science project by adding the following functionality:\nWorkbenches\nStorage for your project\u2019s cluster\nData connections\nModel servers\nPrerequisites\nYou have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\nIf you are using specialized OpenShift AI groups, you are part of the user group or admin group\n(for example, \nrhoai-users\n or \nrhoai-admins\n ) in OpenShift.\nProcedure\n1\n. \nFrom the OpenShift AI dashboard, click \nData Science Projects\n.\nThe \nData science projects\n page opens.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\nThe \nCreate a data science project\n dialog opens.\n3\n. \nEnter a \nname\n for your data science project.\n4\n. \nOptional: Edit the \nresource name\n for your data science project. The resource name must\nconsist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, \n-\n, and must start and end with an alphanumeric\ncharacter.\n5\n. \nEnter a\n\n1\n. \nOn the navigation menu, select \nData Science Projects\n. This page lists any existing projects that\nyou have access to. From this page, you can select an existing project (if any) or create a new\none.\nIf you already have an active project that you\u2019d like to use, select it now and skip ahead to the\nnext section, \nStoring data with data connections\n. Otherwise, continue to the next step.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\n3\n. \nEnter a display name and description. Based on the display name, a resource name is\nautomatically generated, but you can change it if you\u2019d like.\nVerification\nYou can now see its initial state. There are five types of project components:\nRed Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed 2.8 OpenShift AI tutorial - Fraud detection example\n6\n\nis not shown on the \nData science projects\n page. In addition, you cannot use features\nexclusive to OpenShift AI, such as workbenches and model serving, with a standard\nOpenShift project.\nTo classify your OpenShift project as a data science project, and to make available\nfeatures exclusive to OpenShift AI, you must add the label \nopendatahub.io/dashboard:\n \n'true'\n to the project namespace. After you add this label, your project is subsequently\nshown on the \nData science projects\n page.\n3.1. USING DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS\n3.1.1.
