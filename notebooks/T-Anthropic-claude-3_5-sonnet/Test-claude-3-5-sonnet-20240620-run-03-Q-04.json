{"final_response": "Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with a list and short description of the tools I have access to. Here's a summary:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators:\n   This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. It provides details such as name, namespace, version, and status of available operators.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace:\n   This tool summarizes pod information in a specified OpenShift namespace. It provides details on pod states, counts, and for running pods, it includes service information if available.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace:\n   This tool summarizes services information in a given OpenShift namespace. It provides a list of available services and their properties such as name, port numbers, and route information.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter:\n   This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. It's useful for discovering metrics based on specific criteria.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range:\n   This tool retrieves metric values and associated timestamps for a specific metric within a given time range from a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO:\n   This tool calculates timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string based on given time information. It's useful for time-based queries and calculations.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate:\n   This tool creates a file with a plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric's values over a specified time range, using data from a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config:\n   This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. It's useful for optimizing system configurations.\n\n9. RAG_tool:\n   This tool is specifically used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. It's a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tool that can answer queries related to OpenShift AI.\n\nThese tools cover a range of functionalities from OpenShift cluster management to metric analysis and AI-assisted configuration generation. They can be very helpful in managing and optimizing OpenShift environments, working with Prometheus metrics, and gathering information about OpenShift AI.", "total_tokens": 3318, "total_time_seconds": 8.178061246871948, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
