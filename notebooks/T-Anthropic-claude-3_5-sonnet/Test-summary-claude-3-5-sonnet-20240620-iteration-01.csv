2. Port: 10901, Name: grpc, Protocol: TCP

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports configured:
1. The main web interface is accessible on port 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC port on 10901.

It's worth noting that the route for this service is listed as ""unavailable"", which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration.

- Node-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process-level metrics
- Prometheus-specific metrics
- Custom application metrics (e.g., load_generator metrics)

Some examples of the metrics include:

- node_cpu_seconds_total
- node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes
- node_disk_io_time_seconds_total
- node_network_receive_bytes_total
- process_cpu_seconds_total
- scrape_duration_seconds
- load_generator_avg_latency_ms

Q-23,6501,10.332470893859863,"Great! The MLASP_generate_config tool has provided us with a configuration for WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified precision. Let me break down the results for you:

1. Predicted KPI value: 309.85 (which is within 2.9% of the target 307)
2. Deviation: 0.93% (well within the 2.9% precision you requested)

Here's the configuration of WireMock parameters that supports this KPI:

1. asyncResp: 1.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 11

4. jacptQSize: 1660
5. jacptThreads: 136
6. ltTargetSize: 6

8. timeoutSeconds: 3

This configuration is expected to provide a throughput KPI of approximately 309.85, which is very close to your target of 307 and well within the 2.9% precision boundary you specified.

To implement this configuration in WireMock, you would need to set these parameters accordingly in your WireMock setup. The exact method for setting these parameters may depend on how you're using WireMock (e.g., programmatically or via configuration files), but these values should give you a good starting point for achieving your desired throughput KPI.
