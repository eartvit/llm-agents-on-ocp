{"final_response": "Based on the information from our knowledge base, I can guide you through the process of creating a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI:\n   Ensure that you have logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift AI dashboard. If you're using specialized OpenShift AI groups, make sure you're part of the user group or admin group (e.g., rhoai-users or rhoai-admins) in OpenShift.\n\n2. Navigate to Data Science Projects:\n   From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on \"Data Science Projects\" in the navigation menu.\n\n3. Create a new project:\n   On the Data Science Projects page, click the \"Create data science project\" button.\n\n4. Fill in the project details:\n   In the \"Create a data science project\" dialog that opens:\n   a. Enter a name for your data science project.\n   b. Optionally, edit the resource name. Note that the resource name must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.\n   c. Enter a description for your data science project.\n\n5. Create the project:\n   Click the \"Create\" button to finalize the creation of your project.\n\n6. Verify the creation:\n   After creation, you'll be taken to the project details page. Your new project should also be displayed on the Data Science Projects page.\n\nOnce your project is created, you can enhance it by adding various components:\n\n- Workbenches: for your development environment\n- Cluster storage: for storing your project's data\n- Data connections: for connecting to external data sources\n- Model servers: for deploying your models\n- Pipelines: for creating and managing machine learning workflows\n\nRemember, creating a Data Science Project helps you organize your work in one place and provides access to the various tools and resources available in Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to do next with your Data Science Project, such as setting up a workbench or adding storage?", "total_tokens": 7278, "total_time_seconds": 8.602216005325317, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "How to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI?"}, "id": "toolu_01PTpNVsTXhykv1drX4EcvoH", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01PTpNVsTXhykv1drX4EcvoH": "CHAPTER 4.

From this page, you can create workbenches, add cluster storage\nand data connections, import pipelines, and deploy models.\nVerification\nThe project that you created is displayed on the \nData science projects\n page.\n3.1.2. Updating a data science project\nYou can update your data science project\u2019s details by changing your project\u2019s name and description text.\nPrerequisites\nYou have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\n1\n. \nOn the navigation menu, select \nData Science Projects\n. This page lists any existing projects that\nyou have access to. From this page, you can select an existing project (if any) or create a new\none.\nIf you already have an active project that you\u2019d like to use, select it now and skip ahead to the\nnext section, \nStoring data with data connections\n. Otherwise, continue to the next step.\n2\n. \nClick \nCreate data science project\n.\n3\n. \nEnter a display name and description. Based on the display name, a resource name is\nautomatically generated, but you can change it if you\u2019d like.\nVerification\nYou can now see its initial state. There are five types of project components:\nRed Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed 2.8 OpenShift AI tutorial - Fraud detection example\n6\n\nis not shown on the \nData science projects\n page. In addition, you cannot use features\nexclusive to OpenShift AI, such as workbenches and model serving, with a standard\nOpenShift project.\nTo classify your OpenShift project as a data science project, and to make available\nfeatures exclusive to OpenShift AI, you must add the label \nopendatahub.io/dashboard:\n \n'true'\n to the project namespace.
