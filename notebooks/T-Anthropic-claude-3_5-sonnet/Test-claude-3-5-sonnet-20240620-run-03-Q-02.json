{"final_response": "I have access to several tools that can help with various tasks related to OpenShift, Prometheus, and Red Hat OpenShift AI. Here's a list of the tools I can use:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators: This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: This tool summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: This tool lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: This tool calculates the timestamp, the ISO formatted string, and the timezone string of the requested time information.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate: This tool creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config: This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary.\n\n9. RAG_tool: This tool is used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nThese tools allow me to gather information about OpenShift environments, work with Prometheus metrics, handle time-related calculations, create plots, generate configurations, and retrieve information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. Let me know if you have any specific questions or tasks related to these tools, and I'll be happy to assist you.", "total_tokens": 3218, "total_time_seconds": 6.711027383804321, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
