{"final_response": "Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with a list and short description of the tools I have access to. Here they are:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators\n   This tool lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. It provides details such as name, namespace, version, and status of available operators.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace\n   This tool summarizes pod information in an OpenShift namespace. It returns details about the namespace, pod states, counts, and for running pods, it provides information about services and routes if available.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace\n   This tool summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. It provides a list of available services and their properties such as name, port numbers, and route information.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter\n   This tool lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. It's useful for querying specific metrics based on a filter criterion.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range\n   This tool retrieves application metric values and associated timestamps from a Prometheus instance within a specified time range for a given metric name.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO\n   This tool calculates timestamp, ISO formatted string, and timezone string for a requested time information. It can work with relative time inputs like \"4 hours from now\" or \"3 hours ago\".\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate\n   This tool creates a file with a plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric's values over a specified time range, using data from a Prometheus instance.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config\n   This tool generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. It searches for configurations over a specified number of epochs.\n\n9. RAG_tool\n   This tool is used for searching information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. It can be used to query and retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base.\n\nThese tools cover a range of functionalities from OpenShift cluster management to metric analysis and AI-assisted configuration generation. They can be very helpful in managing and analyzing OpenShift environments, working with Prometheus metrics, and even in AI-driven optimization tasks.", "total_tokens": 3319, "total_time_seconds": 8.14514946937561, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
