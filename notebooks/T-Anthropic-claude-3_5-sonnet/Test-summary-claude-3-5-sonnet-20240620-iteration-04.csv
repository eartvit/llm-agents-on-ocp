Q-07,7250,8.46520709991455,"Thank you for providing that information. I'll now explain how to create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI based on the details retrieved.

To create a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.

2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on ""Data Science Projects"".

3. On the Data Science Projects page, click the ""Create data science project"" button.

4. In the ""Create a data science project"" dialog that opens, you'll need to provide the following information:
   - Name: Enter a name for your data science project.
   - Resource name: This is optional. If you don't specify one, it will be automatically generated based on the project name. If you choose to edit it, remember that it must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
   - Description: Enter a description for your project.

5. After filling in the required information, click the ""Create"" button.

6. A project details page will open. From this page, you can enhance your project by adding various components such as:
   - Workbenches
   - Cluster storage
   - Data connections
   - Pipelines (you can import these)
   - Model servers (for deploying models)

To verify that your project has been created successfully, you should see it listed on the ""Data science projects"" page.

It's worth noting that creating a Data Science Project in OpenShift AI provides you with a centralized place to organize your work and access various data science tools and resources. This project structure allows you to manage different aspects of your data science workflow efficiently, from data storage and processing to model development and deployment.

Q-23,6470,9.467182397842407,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with the configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI of approximately 307 within the specified 2.9 percent precision. Here are the details:

1. asyncResp: 1.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 11
3. cThreads: 224
4. jacptQSize: 1248
5. jacptThreads: 113
6. ltTargetSize: 6

This configuration is predicted to achieve a throughput KPI of 309.21, which is within the desired precision range. The deviation from the target KPI (307) is approximately 0.72%, which is well within the specified 2.9% precision.

To break it down:
- The predicted KPI value is 309.21, which is very close to the desired 307.
- The deviation is 0.72%, which is significantly better than the maximum allowed 2.9%.

This configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving the desired throughput KPI of 307 in your WireMock setup. You may want to implement these settings and run tests to verify the actual performance in your specific environment."
