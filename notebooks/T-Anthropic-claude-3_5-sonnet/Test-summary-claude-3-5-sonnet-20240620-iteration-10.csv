1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.

2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on ""Data Science Projects"".

3. On the Data Science Projects page, click the ""Create data science project"" button.

4. In the ""Create a data science project"" dialog that opens, you'll need to provide the following information:

   a. Enter a name for your data science project.
   b. Optionally, you can edit the resource name. If you do, remember that it must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
   c. Enter a description for your data science project.

5. Click the ""Create"" button.

After creation, a project details page will open. From this page, you can enhance your project by:
- Creating workbenches
- Adding cluster storage and data connections
- Importing pipelines
- Deploying models

To verify that your project was created successfully, you should see it listed on the Data Science Projects page.

It's worth noting that a data science project in OpenShift AI helps you organize your work in one place and provides access to various components such as:
- Workbenches
- Storage for your project's cluster
- Data connections
- Model servers

This structure allows you to manage all aspects of your data science workflow within a single project environment.

Q-15,6168,4.712736368179321,"Based on the information retrieved, I can answer your question:

Yes, there is a Prometheus service running in the ""demo"" namespace. Here are the details:

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports:
1. The main web interface port: 9090
2. A gRPC port: 10901

Both ports use the TCP protocol. It's worth noting that the service doesn't have an associated route, which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration."

   - Various `go_*` metrics related to the Go runtime
   - `jvm_*` metrics for Java Virtual Machine statistics
   - `load_generator_*` metrics, which seem to be related to a load testing tool
   - `node_*` metrics providing information about the node (CPU, memory, network, etc.)

Q-18,6458,9.589383602142334,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, here's the configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI close to 307 within the specified 2.9 percent precision:

1. asyncResp: 0.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 28
3. cThreads: 203
4. jacptQSize: 1334
5. jacptThreads: 134
6. ltTargetSize: 8

8. timeoutSeconds: 4

This configuration is predicted to achieve a throughput KPI of approximately 304.45, which is within 0.83% of the target value (307). This is well within the specified precision of 2.9%.

To break it down:
- The prediction (304.45) is very close to the desired KPI value (307).
- The deviation is about 0.83%, which is significantly better than the requested 2.9% precision.

This configuration should provide a good starting point for achieving the desired throughput KPI in WireMock. You may want to test this configuration in your actual environment to verify its performance, as real-world results may vary slightly from the prediction."
