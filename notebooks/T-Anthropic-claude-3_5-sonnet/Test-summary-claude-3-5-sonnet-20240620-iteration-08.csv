Q-07,7201,8.013184547424316,"Thank you for providing that information. I'll guide you through the process of creating a Data Science Project in Red Hat OpenShift AI based on the documentation.

Here's how you can create a Data Science Project:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift AI.

2. From the OpenShift AI dashboard, click on ""Data Science Projects"".

3. On the ""Data science projects"" page, click the ""Create data science project"" button.

4. A ""Create a data science project"" dialog will open. Here, you need to provide the following information:

   a. Enter a name for your data science project.
   b. (Optional) Edit the resource name for your project. If you do this, remember that the resource name must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-), and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
   c. Enter a description for your data science project.

5. After filling in the required information, click ""Create"".

6. A project details page will open. From this page, you can further enhance your project by:
   - Creating workbenches
   - Adding cluster storage and data connections
   - Importing pipelines
   - Deploying models

To verify that your project has been created successfully, you should see it displayed on the ""Data science projects"" page.

Once your project is created, you'll have access to five types of project components, although the documentation doesn't specify what these are.

Remember, if you're using specialized OpenShift AI groups, you need to be part of the user group or admin group (for example, 'rhoai-users' or 'rhoai-admins') in OpenShift to create a project.

Is there any specific aspect of creating a Data Science Project that you'd like more information on?"

The Prometheus service is named ""prometheus-operated"" and it has two ports configured:
1. The main web interface is accessible on port 9090.
2. There's also a gRPC interface on port 10901.

It's worth noting that the route for this service is listed as ""unavailable"", which means it might not be directly accessible from outside the cluster without additional configuration.

- Node-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process-level metrics
- JVM metrics
- Load generator metrics
- Network and socket statistics
- Filesystem metrics
- Timex and time-related metrics

Q-23,6565,10.545101881027222,"Based on the results from the MLASP_generate_config tool, I can provide you with the configuration of WireMock that supports a throughput KPI of approximately 307 within the specified 2.9 percent precision. Here's the configuration:

1. asyncResp: 1.0
2. asyncRespThreads: 6
3. cThreads: 220
4. jacptQSize: 1210
5. jacptThreads: 110
6. ltTargetSize: 14
7. numConnections: 31
8. timeoutSeconds: 5

This configuration is predicted to achieve a KPI value of approximately 311.03, which is within the specified precision of 2.9% from the target value of 307. The actual deviation is about 1.31%, which is well within the acceptable range.

To break it down:
- The asynchronous response is enabled (asyncResp = 1.0) with 6 asynchronous response threads.
- The number of client threads (cThreads) is set to 220.
- The Jetty acceptor queue size (jacptQSize) is set to 1210.
- The number of Jetty acceptor threads (jacptThreads) is 110.
- The load test target size (ltTargetSize) is 14.
- The number of connections (numConnections) is set to 31.
- The timeout is set to 5 seconds.

This configuration should provide a good balance of performance parameters to achieve the desired throughput KPI of around 307 requests per second, with the actual prediction being slightly higher at 311.03 requests per second."

This table shows the timestamp and corresponding metric value for the `load_generator_total_msg` metric across different instances. Each instance's data is separated by a blank line. The ellipsis (...) indicates that intermediate data points have been omitted for brevity.

The data shows the progression of the total message count over time for each instance of the load generator. You can observe that the metric values generally increase over time, which is expected for a cumulative metric like total messages."
