This could be from databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.\n\n3. Explore and Clean Data: Analyze the data to understand its structure and content. Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and errors.\n\n4. Preprocess Data: Convert the data into a format that can be used for modeling. This could involve feature engineering, normalization, etc.\n\n5. Choose a Model: Select an appropriate machine learning model based on the problem and data.\n\n6. Train the Model: Use the data to train the model. This involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize error.\n\n7. Evaluate the Model: Test the model's performance using a separate set of data. This helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n8. Deploy the Model: Once the model is performing satisfactorily, it can be deployed to a production environment.\n\n9. Monitor and Maintain: Continuously monitor the model's performance and make necessary adjustments or retrain the model as needed.""}","{'total_tokens': 2633, 'total_time_seconds': 2.5937957763671875, 'final_response': 'Paris is the capital city of France, known for its romantic atmosphere, iconic landmarks, and rich history.
