- Add cluster storage for your project data 
- Set up data connections to access data sources
- Import pipelines for your machine learning workflows
- Deploy trained models to model servers

7. Organize your data, notebooks, scripts, trained models, etc. within the project.

8. Follow data science best practices for your project development:

- Clearly define the business problem and success criteria 
- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights
- Prepare the data for modeling (cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)
- Select appropriate modeling techniques and train models
- Evaluate model performance and iterate
- Deploy models to production when they meet performance requirements
- Monitor deployed models and collect new data for retraining
