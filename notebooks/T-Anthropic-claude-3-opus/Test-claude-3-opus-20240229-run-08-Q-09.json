The tools and data I have access to are focused on managing and monitoring software systems, especially Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. They do not contain any geographical data that would allow me to answer a question about the presence of rivers. If you can provide more context about a specific location you are curious about, I may be able to search for that information from other sources. But based solely on the tools available to me here, I cannot determine if there is a river. Let me know if there are any other topics related to the tools I described that I can assist with!", "total_tokens": 3221, "total_time_seconds": 10.66024923324585, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
