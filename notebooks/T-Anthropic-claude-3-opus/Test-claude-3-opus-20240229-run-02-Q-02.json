I can simply list out the names of the tools from that original list to answer the user's question.\n</thinking>\n\nHere are the tools I have access to:\n\nList_OpenShift_Operators - Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\nSummarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarize pods information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\nSummarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarize services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\nList_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter - List available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\nList_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range - List the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\nGet_timestamp_and_time_ISO - Calculate the timestamp, the iso formatted string and the timezone string of the requested time information.\n\nFile_create_plot_irate - Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance\n\nMLASP_generate_config - Generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Searches for the parameter configurations a given number of epochs.\n\nRAG_tool - Use this tool when seaching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI\n\nLet me know if you need more details on what any of these tools do and how to use them.
