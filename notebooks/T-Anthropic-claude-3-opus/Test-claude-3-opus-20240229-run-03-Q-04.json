{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe user is asking for a list and short description of the tools I have access to. The RAG_tool allows searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI, which could be helpful to provide an overview, but its query parameter requires a specific query, not just a general list. None of the other tools seem directly relevant for generating a list and short description of all the tools.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is a list of the tools I have access to, along with a brief description of each:\n\nList_OpenShift_Operators - Lists information about OpenShift operators in a given namespace, such as the operator name, version, and status.\n\nSummarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Provides a summary of pod information in an OpenShift namespace, including pod states, counts, names, and associated services and routes for running pods. \n\nSummarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarizes information about services in an OpenShift namespace, listing service names, port numbers, and route details.\n\nList_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter - Lists available Prometheus metric names that match a provided filter. Requires specifying the Prometheus service name, namespace, port, and a filter name/value.\n\nList_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range - Retrieves values and timestamps for a specific Prometheus metric between a provided start and end time range. \n\nGet_timestamp_and_time_ISO - Calculates a timestamp, ISO formatted datetime string, and timezone based on an input time value (e.g. \"4 hours from now\").\n\nFile_create_plot_irate - Creates a plot file of the instantaneous rate (irate) of a Prometheus metric over a specified time range.\n\nMLASP_generate_config - Uses machine learning to generate a set of parameter configurations predicted to achieve a desired KPI value within a given precision. Searches over a specified number of epochs.\n\nRAG_tool - Allows searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI based on a provided query.\n\nLet me know if you need any more details on a specific tool and I'll be happy to elaborate further!", "total_tokens": 3515, "total_time_seconds": 22.41179132461548, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
