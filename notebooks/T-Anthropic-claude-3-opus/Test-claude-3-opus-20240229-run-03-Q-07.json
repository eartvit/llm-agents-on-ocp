From the OpenShift AI dashboard, go to the Data Science Projects page. \n\n2. Click the \"Create data science project\" button.\n\n3. Enter a name for your project. Optionally, you can also edit the auto-generated resource name.\n\n4. Add a description for your project.\n\n5. Click \"Create\". This will open the project details page.\n\n6. From the project page, you can add various components to your data science project:\n\n- Create workbenches for developing and testing your models\n- Add cluster storage for your project data \n- Set up data connections to access data sources\n- Import pipelines for your machine learning workflows\n- Deploy trained models to model servers\n\n7. Organize your data, notebooks, scripts, trained models, etc. within the project.\n\n8. Follow data science best practices for your project development:\n\n- Clearly define the business problem and success criteria \n- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights\n- Prepare the data for modeling (cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)\n- Select appropriate modeling techniques and train models\n- Evaluate model performance and iterate\n- Deploy models to production when they meet performance requirements\n- Monitor deployed models and collect new data for retraining\n\nThe key is to use the project as a centralized place to manage all the assets and lifecycle of your data science initiative.
