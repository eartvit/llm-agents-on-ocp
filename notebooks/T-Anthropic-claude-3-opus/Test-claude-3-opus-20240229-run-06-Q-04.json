{"final_response": "<thinking>\nTo provide a list and descriptions of the available tools, I can simply extract that information from the JSON schemas provided for each tool in the context. No additional tools or parameters are needed.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is a list of the tools I have access to, along with a short description of each:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators: Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. Returns an object containing the list of operator information for the available operators such as name, namespace, version and status.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace. Returns an object containing the name of namespace and pod state and count information. For the running pods it also returns its name and if available any service information such as service name, service ports and route.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. Returns an object containing the name of namespace and a list of the available services and their properties such as name, port numbers and route information.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. Returns an object containing the available metric names. \n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. Returns an object containing the list of the desired application metric values and associated timestamp information.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: Calculates the timestamp, the iso formatted string and the timezone string of the requested time information based on input parameters specifying a time offset from the current time.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. Returns the name of the file containing the plot.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config: Generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Searches for the parameter configurations for a given number of epochs. Returns an object containing a list of parameter names and associated values alongside the prediction and precision values of the configuration set.\n\n9. RAG_tool: Retrieves information about Red Hat OpenShift AI based on a provided query.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details about the capabilities of these tools!", "total_tokens": 3601, "total_time_seconds": 26.496939420700073, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
