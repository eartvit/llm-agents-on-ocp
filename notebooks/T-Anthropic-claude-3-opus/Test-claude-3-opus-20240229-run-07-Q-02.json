{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe user is asking what tools I have access to in this environment. Looking at the available tools, there are a number of them related to getting information about Kubernetes/OpenShift and Prometheus monitoring, as well as some ML parameter optimization tools.\n\nTo directly answer the user's question, I don't need to actually call any of the tools at this point. I can just provide a high-level summary of the capabilities the tools provide me with.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is an overview of the main tools and capabilities I have access to in this environment:\n\nOpenShift/Kubernetes Information:\n- List OpenShift operators in a given namespace \n- Summarize pods and their state in a namespace\n- Summarize services and their properties in a namespace\n\nPrometheus Metrics:\n- List available Prometheus metric names using a filter\n- Retrieve values for a specific Prometheus metric over a time range\n- Plot the instantaneous rate (irate) of a metric over time\n\nTime Utilities:\n- Get timestamp and ISO formatted time for a given relative time (e.g. \"4 hours from now\")\n\nMachine Learning:\n- Use MLASP to generate an optimal set of configuration parameters to achieve a target KPI value within a precision boundary\n\nDocumentation:\n- Look up information about Red Hat OpenShift using a retrieval and generation (RAG) based tool\n\nSo in summary, the tools allow me to inspect the state of an OpenShift/Kubernetes environment, analyze Prometheus metrics, work with timestamps, optimize ML parameters, and search Red Hat OpenShift docs. Let me know if you have any other questions about the capabilities!", "total_tokens": 3377, "total_time_seconds": 19.328650951385498, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
