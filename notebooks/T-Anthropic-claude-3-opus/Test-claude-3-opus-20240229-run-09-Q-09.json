{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe input question \"Is there a river?\" does not contain enough contextual information to determine relevance to any of the available tools, which are focused on OpenShift, Prometheus metrics, and AI/ML topics. None of the tools take parameters related to rivers or geographic features.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but based on the tools and information available to me, I do not have enough context to determine if there is a river in a particular location. The tools I have access to are focused on topics like OpenShift, Prometheus monitoring, and AI/ML model configuration. They do not contain information about rivers or other geographic features. If you can provide more details on the specific location or context you are asking about, I may be able to better assist in finding relevant information, even if it is not through the use of the tools listed here.
