{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe request is asking for the list of available tools and a short description of each one. This information is fully provided in the function specifications, so no additional information is needed from the user.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is the list of tools I have access to, along with a short description of each one:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators: Lists OpenShift operator information in a given namespace, such as operator name, namespace, version and status.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes pod information in an OpenShift namespace, including pod name, state, count, and any associated service information like service name, ports and route.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes service information in an OpenShift namespace, providing a list of available services and their properties such as name, port numbers and route information.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using a provided filter. Requires specifying the Prometheus service name, namespace, port, and the filter name and value to use. \n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: Lists the values and associated timestamps for a given metric name stored in Prometheus between a provided start and end timestamp. Requires the Prometheus service info, metric name, and start/end timestamp range.\n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO: Calculates the timestamp, ISO formatted date time string, and timezone string for a requested relative or current time. Takes in a time value (integer or \"now\"), a time metric (e.g. seconds, minutes, etc), and an \"ago\" flag.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate: Creates a plot file of the instantaneous rate (irate) of a metric's values over a specified time range. Requires the same Prometheus and metric inputs as the list_metric_values function.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config: Generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Requires the number of epochs to search, the target KPI value, and the acceptable precision percentage.\n\n9. RAG_tool: A general purpose search tool for finding information about Red Hat OpenShift AI. Takes in a query string to look up in its retriever system.\n\nLet me know if you need any additional details on these tools and their capabilities!", "total_tokens": 3578, "total_time_seconds": 26.578119039535522, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
