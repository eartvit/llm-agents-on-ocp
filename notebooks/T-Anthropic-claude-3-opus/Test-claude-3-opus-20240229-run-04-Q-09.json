{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe request \"Is there a river?\" does not relate to any of the provided tools which focus on getting information about OpenShift, Prometheus metrics, and machine learning assisted application configuration parameters.

The tools I have access to relate to cloud native application platforms and machine learning, so they cannot help answer your question about the presence of a river. If you can provide more context on the specific location you are interested in, I may be able to do some additional research to try to find that information for you.
