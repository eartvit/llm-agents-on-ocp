{"final_response": "<search_quality_reflection>\nThe RAG tool results provide more specific information on some of the AI tools and services available in Red Hat OpenShift AI, such as Anaconda Professional, IBM Watson Studio, Intel oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit, and Jupyter. This gives a better sense of the types of capabilities the platform offers.\n\nHowever, it still doesn't appear to be a complete list, as the results mention \"the following services\" but then only list a few. Additional searches may be needed to get a truly comprehensive view of all the available tools. The information so far is helpful to answer the question at a high level, but more details would be ideal to fully address what was asked.\n</search_quality_reflection>\n<search_quality_score>4</search_quality_score>\n\n<result>\nBased on the information I was able to find, here is an overview of the AI tools and features available in Red Hat OpenShift AI:\n\nKey features for data scientists and IT ops:\n- Ability to embed AI/ML into business applications \n- Create custom models using your own data\n- Accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines\n\nSome of the specific tools and services supported include:\n\n- Anaconda Professional - Open source package distribution optimized for commercial use\n- IBM Watson Studio - Platform for embedding AI/ML and creating custom models \n- Intel oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit - Set of AI software tools to accelerate data science workflows on Intel architectures\n- Jupyter notebooks\n- API tiers for accessing capabilities\n\nThe platform also provides getting started guides to learn how to work in the OpenShift AI environment.\n\nWhile this covers some of the key capabilities, the information I found did not appear to be an exhaustive list of every single tool available. There are likely additional tools and features beyond what I was able to summarize here. Let me know if you need any other details on specific AI/ML tools or use cases you are interested in and I can try to find more targeted information.\n</result>", "total_tokens": 12075, "total_time_seconds": 39.60766816139221, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "What tools are available in Red Hat OpenShift AI?"}, "id": "toolu_01YNzZ6pKD9GqeeQZp28fuL3", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "RAG_tool", "args": {"query": "List all the AI tools available in Red Hat OpenShift AI"}, "id": "toolu_01NV5QcKMtz7RUpUUSFqcg4Z", "type": "tool_call"}, "3": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01YNzZ6pKD9GqeeQZp28fuL3": "CHAPTER 7.
