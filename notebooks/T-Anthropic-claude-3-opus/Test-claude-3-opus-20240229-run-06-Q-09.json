{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe user's question \"Is there a river?\" is very broad and open-ended. They have not provided any specifics about what location or context they are asking about. \n\nThe provided tools allow for getting information about OpenShift namespaces, operators, pods and services, as well as querying Prometheus metrics. However, none of these tools would help determine if there is a river in an unspecified location.\n\nThe RAG_tool could potentially search for relevant information to answer the question, but it requires a specific query. Simply searching for \"is there a river\" would not likely return a meaningful result without more context.\n\nSince no additional details were provided to narrow down the location in question, and the available tools are not sufficient to determine the presence of a river with such limited information, I will need to ask the user for clarification.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine if there is a river. Can you please provide more context about the specific location you are asking about? Without knowing where you are referring to, I am unable to check if a river is present there. The tools I have access to are focused on providing information about OpenShift and Prometheus, which are not directly relevant to answering a question about rivers in an unspecified place. Please let me know the geographic area you need river information for, and I will do my best to assist you further.", "total_tokens": 3322, "total_time_seconds": 13.766162157058716, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
