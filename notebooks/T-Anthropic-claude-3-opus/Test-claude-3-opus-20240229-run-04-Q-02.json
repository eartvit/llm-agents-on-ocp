{"final_response": "<thinking>\nTo answer the question \"What tools do you have access to?\", I don't need to use any of the provided tools. The question is simply asking me to list out the tools that are available to me, which I can do by looking at the function definitions provided.\n</thinking>\n\nBased on the function definitions provided, I have access to the following tools:\n\n1. List_OpenShift_Operators - Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\n2. Summarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarizes pod information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n3. Summarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\n4. List_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter - Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\n5. List_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range - Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and end timestamp for a given metric name stored in Prometheus. \n\n6. Get_timestamp_and_time_ISO - Calculates the timestamp, ISO formatted string and timezone string for a requested time.\n\n7. File_create_plot_irate - Creates a file with a plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric between a start and end timestamp.\n\n8. MLASP_generate_config - Generates a set of parameter configurations to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary.\n\n9. RAG_tool - A tool to search for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nSo in summary, the tools provide capabilities to interact with OpenShift, Prometheus monitoring, time calculations, plotting metrics, AI-based configuration optimization, and a knowledge retrieval system. Let me know if you need any other details about the specific capabilities of each tool!", "total_tokens": 3443, "total_time_seconds": 17.440342664718628, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
