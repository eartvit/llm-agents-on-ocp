For creating a data science project, the provided tools do not seem directly relevant. The tools are focused on retrieving information and metrics from OpenShift and Prometheus, as well as generating parameter configurations to meet a KPI target. None of them are about the general process of creating a data science project.

To properly answer this query, I would need to provide guidance on the typical steps and best practices for data science projects, such as:

1. Defining the problem statement and objectives 
2. Collecting and preparing the data
3. Exploring and visualizing the data 
4. Building and evaluating models
5. Deploying models and monitoring performance

Since the user's request is quite broad, I don't have enough specific information to use the available tools to assist in answering. The best approach is to provide a high-level overview of the data science project lifecycle.
</thinking>

To create a data science project, you can follow these general steps:

1. Define the problem statement
- Clearly articulate the business problem you are trying to solve with data 
- Identify the objectives and key results you want to achieve
- Determine what data sources may be relevant

2. Collect and prepare the data
- Gather data from relevant internal and external sources
- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies
- Transform and normalize the data into a suitable format for analysis

3. Explore and visualize the data
- Understand the characteristics, patterns and relationships in the data
- Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques  
- Form hypotheses to test based on initial exploration

4. Build and evaluate models
- Split data into training, validation and test sets
- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type
- Train models on the data and tune hyperparameters
- Evaluate model performance on validation data using relevant metrics

5. Deploy models and monitor
- Integrate selected models into a production environment for generating predictions
- Set up monitoring to track model performance on live data over time
- Retrain and update models periodically based on new data and feedback

The specific tools and techniques used in each step can vary based on the nature of the data science problem. Popular programming languages for data science include Python and R. Key libraries include pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

I would recommend starting by clearly defining your problem statement and success criteria. Then begin collecting and exploring the relevant data before iterating on building models. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
