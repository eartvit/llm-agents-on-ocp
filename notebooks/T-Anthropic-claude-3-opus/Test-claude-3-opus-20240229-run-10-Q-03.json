{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe user is asking for a list of the tools I have access to. The RAG_tool can be used to look up information about Red Hat OpenShift AI which could provide a high-level overview, but it would not give a full list of the specific tools available. None of the other tools seem directly relevant for listing out the tools. To fully answer the user's request, I will need to directly provide the list of tools from the context that was given to me.\n</thinking>\n\nHere is the list of tools I have access to:\n\nList_OpenShift_Operators - Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace.\n\nSummarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarize pods information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\nSummarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace - Summarize services information in an OpenShift namespace.\n\nList_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter - List available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter.\n\nList_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range - List the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\nGet_timestamp_and_time_ISO - Calculate the timestamp, the iso formatted string and the timezone string of the requested time information.  \n\nFile_create_plot_irate - Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance.\n\nMLASP_generate_config - Generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Searches for the parameter configurations a given number of epochs.\n\nRAG_tool - Use this tool when searching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nLet me know if you need more details on what any specific tool does.", "total_tokens": 3462, "total_time_seconds": 20.14304828643799, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
