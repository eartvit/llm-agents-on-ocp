{"final_response": "The MLASP_generate_config tool returned an error indicating the prediction value is not a valid float. It seems the tool was not able to find a valid configuration that meets the provided KPI and precision criteria within the specified 100 epochs. \n\nTo troubleshoot this, we could try a few things:\n1. Increase the number of epochs to search over a larger space of possible configurations. \n2. Relax the precision requirement to allow more configurations to be considered valid.\n3. Verify that the target KPI value of 307 is achievable for the WireMock application under some configuration.\n\nWithout more context on the typical throughput values for WireMock, it's difficult to determine if 307 is a reasonable target. We may need to consult application experts or documentation.\n\nIn summary, the provided parameters were complete to attempt configuration generation, but the tool was unable to find a valid result in 100 epochs for a KPI of 307 with 2.9% precision. Additional troubleshooting and potentially adjusting the parameters would be the next steps. Let me know if you would like to try modifying any of the inputs or have additional information to provide about expected throughput ranges for WireMock.", "total_tokens": 6961, "total_time_seconds": 28.875550985336304, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "MLASP_generate_config", "args": {"epochs": 100, "KPI_value": 307, "precision": 0.029}, "id": "toolu_01Ui4PrBaEU8cdUXxsuSoVuh", "type": "tool_call"}, "2": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {"toolu_01Ui4PrBaEU8cdUXxsuSoVuh": "Error: ValidationError(model='ConfigSetup', errors=[{'loc': ('prediction',), 'msg': 'value is not a valid float', 'type': 'type_error.float'}])\n Please fix your mistakes."}}
