{"final_response": "<thinking>The user is requesting a list of the available tools I have access to. The query does not require calling any of the tools, just providing information about them. I can provide this by including the descriptions from the function specifications that were provided to me.</thinking>\n\nHere are the tools I have access to, along with a brief description of each:\n\nList_OpenShift_Operators: Lists OpenShift operators information in a given namespace. Returns an object containing the list of operator information for the available operators such as name, namespace, version and status.\n\nSummarize_Pods_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes pods information in an OpenShift namespace. Returns an object containing the name of namespace and pod state and count information. For the running pods it also returns its name and if available any service information such as service name, service ports and route.\n\nSummarize_Services_Information_In_OpenShift_Namespace: Summarizes services information in an OpenShift namespace. Returns an object containing the name of namespace and a list of the available services and their properties such as name, port numbers and route information.\n\nList_Prometheus_Metrics_Names_Using_A_Filter: Lists available metric names in a Prometheus instance using an input filter. Returns an object containing the available metric names.\n\nList_metric_values_between_a_timestamp_range: Lists the application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. Returns an object containing the list of the desired application metric values and associated timestamp information.\n\nGet_timestamp_and_time_ISO: Calculates the timestamp, the iso formatted string and the timezone string of the requested time information. Returns the timestamp value, the ISO formatted string of the date time value, the timezone string.  \n\nFile_create_plot_irate: Creates a file with the plot of the instantaneous rate (irate) of an application metric values and associated timestamps between a start and an end timestamp interval for a given metric name stored within a Prometheus instance. Returns the name of the file containing the plot.\n\nMLASP_generate_config: Generates a set of parameter configuration to support a desired KPI value within a given precision boundary. Searches for the parameter configurations a given number of epochs. Returns an object containing a list of parameter names and associated values alongside the prediction and precision values of the configuration set.\n\nRAG_tool: A general tool for seaching for information about Red Hat OpenShift AI.\n\nLet me know if you need any additional details on these tools or how to use them!", "total_tokens": 3592, "total_time_seconds": 28.23270845413208, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
