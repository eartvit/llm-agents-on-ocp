{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe provided query is asking about the presence of a river. However, the current set of tools does not contain any that can directly answer this question. The available tools mainly focus on interacting with Kubernetes, OpenShift, Prometheus metrics, and generating application configuration parameters. None of them are related to identifying or locating natural features like rivers.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I do not have the capability to determine if there is a river near a given location. The tools and information currently available to me are focused on managing software applications and infrastructure. I do not have access to geographical data that would allow me to identify natural features like rivers. If you need information on rivers or other natural landmarks, I would suggest consulting maps, atlases, or geographical databases. Let me know if there are other technology topics I can assist with though!", "total_tokens": 3198, "total_time_seconds": 9.352887630462646, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
