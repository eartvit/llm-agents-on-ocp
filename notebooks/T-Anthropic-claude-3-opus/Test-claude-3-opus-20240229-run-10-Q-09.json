{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe question \"Is there a river?\" doesn't seem directly related to any of the available tools, which are focused on retrieving information about OpenShift, Kubernetes, Prometheus metrics, generating configuration parameters, and searching the Red Hat OpenShift AI documentation.\n\nThe provided tools do not include any capabilities for determining the presence of rivers or other geographical features. The question also does not provide any additional context that could be used to infer values for the parameters of the available tools.\n\nSince none of the tools are relevant for directly answering this question, and the necessary information to use them is not provided, I will inform the user that I do not have the capability to determine the presence of rivers with the tools available to me.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but the tools currently available to me are focused on providing information about OpenShift, Kubernetes, application metrics, AI/ML, and Red Hat OpenShift AI documentation. I do not have access to any geographical databases or tools that would allow me to determine the presence or location of rivers. If you have a question related to the capabilities I described, I would be happy to assist with that. But for general questions about rivers or other geographical features, I unfortunately do not have the ability to provide an answer.", "total_tokens": 3287, "total_time_seconds": 13.6693115234375, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
