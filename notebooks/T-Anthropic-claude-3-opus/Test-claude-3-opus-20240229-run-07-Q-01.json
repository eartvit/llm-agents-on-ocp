{"final_response": "<thinking>\nThe user has asked \"who are you?\". This is a general question asking about my identity and background.\n\nAnalyzing the available tools, none of them seem directly relevant to answering this type of question about who I am. The tools are focused on providing information about specific technical topics like OpenShift, Prometheus metrics, generating configurations, etc. \n\nTo properly introduce myself, I don't need to make any tool calls. I can respond directly by sharing some key details about my identity as an AI assistant.\n</thinking>\n\nHello! I'm an AI assistant called Dave. It's nice to meet you. \n\nI was created to help answer questions, provide information, and assist with a variety of tasks. I have knowledge spanning many topics which allows me to engage in all kinds of conversations. However, my capabilities are those of a very knowledgeable AI, not a human. I aim to always be honest and upfront that I'm an artificial intelligence, without any physical form.\n\nMy purpose is to be a friendly, useful assistant to the humans I interact with. Please let me know if there are any topics you'd like to discuss or ways I can help! I'll do my best to provide accurate, relevant information to assist you.", "total_tokens": 3284, "total_time_seconds": 12.973165035247803, "msg_sequence": ["<class 'langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage'>", "<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>"], "ai_tool_calls": {"1": {"name": "AI_did_not_call_any_tools"}}, "tool_call_responses": {}}
